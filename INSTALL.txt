          Installation instructions for Anagram
	  =====================================

What do you need
----------------

* A C++ compiler (recommended GNU C++ compiler)
* Qt Library

(To follow the instructions below you will also need gnu make)

Installation steps
------------------

(The following instructions assume that you are using GNU C++ compiler
along with the GNU make and you already have QT library installed)

1. Untar the source tarball
   	 tar -xvf anagram.tar.gz

2. Change to the extracted directory
   	  cd anagram

3. Build the binaries
       	  make

4. Install the program
   	  make install

(The default makefile installs the binaries to the /usr/local/bin
directory and the dictionary files to the
/usr/local/share/anagram/dictionary
directory. To uninstall remove those directories.)

Custom installation
-------------------

To install Anagram to a custom location you will have to edit the
makefile. In addition to that you have to edit the find.hpp file in
the source directory prior to build.
    	   sed -i find.hpp "s:/usr/local/share/anagram/dictionary:/your/custom/path:"
